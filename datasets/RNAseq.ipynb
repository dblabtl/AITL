    "1). Unknown genes and genes belonging to organisms other than H.sapiens were excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "2). First each query symbol was tried to match with any of current \"Symbol\" directly. If the query symbol mapped to one of current symbol but has no Gene ID, the query symbol was marked as not mapped. \n",
    "\n",
    "3). If the query symbol matches none of current symbols, we tried to match it with one of \"Synonyms\". Genes matched no synonym as well as matched ambiguous synonyms correponding more than one Gene ID were condiered not mapped. \n",
    "\n",
    "4). At this point, many of not recognized symbols had LOCXXXXXXXXX format. \n",
    "According to the documntation provided by NCBI: \"Symbols beginning with LOC. When a published symbol is not available, and orthologs have not yet been determined, Gene will provide a symbol that is constructed as 'LOC' + the GeneID. This is not retained when a replacement symbol has been identified, although queries by the LOC term are still supported. In other words, a record with the symbol LOC12345 is equivalent to GeneID = 12345. So if the symbol changes, the record can still be retrieved on the web using LOC12345 as a query, or from any file using GeneID = 12345\" e.g. :\n",
    "\n",
    "    - LOC100093631 -> 100093631 \n",
    "    - LOC100129726 -> 100129726\n",
    "    - etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore all genes started with LOC were converted to Gene IDs removing \"LOC\" from query term. If resulting Gene ID matched none of current Gene IDs the symbol was considered not mapped. \n",
    "\n",
    "4). Several pairs of query gene symbols matched current symbol and synonym of the same Entrez gene ID, e.g. AGAP8 and AGAP4, ANXA8L1 and ANXA8L2, etc.\n",
    "Expressions of these genes were summarized because such genes were merged to a single gene in newer assembly versions."
